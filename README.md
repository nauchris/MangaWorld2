Yes! I can create a miniture Sims-like Pygame. Simple life simulation where the player can:

Control a character that moves around a small house.
Perform actions like eating, sleeping, or working.
Manage stats (hunger, energy, happiness).
Interact with objects (bed, fridge, computer).
This won’t be a full-blown Sims, but a fun, lightweight, and interactive demo to showcase your skills. 
Updating by adding Manga charecters that are mainstream favs

🎮 Stay tuned. 🚀

ADDED**

A bed (restores energy 🛏️)
A fridge (restores hunger 🍔)
A computer (restores happiness 💻)
